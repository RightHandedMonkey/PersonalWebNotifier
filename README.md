# New

This app has been completely rewritten using Google Room and can be used as an example of how easy it is to work with Room
Room: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html  

This is an open source Android app for programmers to setup notifications for websites that watches for changes and alerts you on your device

It illustrates using:
*Room for retrofit-like database access
*Android JobScheduler to handle the background updates
*Boot Complete Receiver to continue checks after a reboot
*RxJava2 Completables to replace ASyncTask

Future goals:
*Rewrite using MVP
*Implement Dagger2
